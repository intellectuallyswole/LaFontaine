Need to figure out how to install poetry in the buildpack way of doing things.

Still can't get python in the custom build image even though google-22 is supposed to include python 3.10 and python 3.11.

Do I  need to customize the build or run image? https://cloud.google.com/docs/buildpacks/build-run-image 

Useful commands (from server/):

  docker build -t lafontaine-base:2023-12-27a -f builder.Dockerfile .
	pack build lafontaine:2023-12-27a  --builder lafontaine-base:2023-12-27a
	docker run -it -ePORT=8080 -p8080:8080 lafontaine:2023-12-27a
